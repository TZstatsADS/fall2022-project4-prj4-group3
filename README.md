+ Project summary: For this project we studied the algorithms related to Machine Learning Fairness Algorithms. We studied and implemented the algorithms given in papers A1: Learning fair representations (LFR) and   A4: Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact. We used the Compas dataset to implement the algorithm.
